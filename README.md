Code to have extra fun with Fantasy Premier League!

Looking to expand this as I try to have a go at making a machine learning algorithm which can predict fantasy football scores.

Where I am up to right now is using python to scrape all the fantasy football data from the official website. This is done with the importdata.py script. 

If you want to use the data, I will keep alldata.csv updated each week and this contains all the data for every player in a format easily opened by excel or other programming languages.

This is all written in Python3.  I recommend making a new virtual environment to run all this in and then installing the dependencies within it. Using "pip install -r requirements.txt". 

I have recently added some ways to predict player scores using a simple linear regression model. Have a look at linear_regression.py for more info...

Any comments or suggestions welcomed!
